[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

### Question
Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others.  

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?  

## Answer

First babies are lighter than others on average by about 0.12 lbs. Cohen's effect size is -0.089, meaning the difference in mean weights in lbs of first babies and others is -0.089 standard deviations. The difference in weight is greater than the difference in pregnancy length.

```python
import nsfg
import math
import thinkstats2

difference = firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()
print(difference)

d = CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
print(d)
```
